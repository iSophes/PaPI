# PiVitality's PaPI Project.

Download code and run:

- pip install tk
- pip install pillow
- pip install SpeechRecognition
- pip install pyaudio

Then you can run the code. Currently works. The speech recognition may take a small while to get working but it's functional. Only contains three animals and can also respond to sounds!
